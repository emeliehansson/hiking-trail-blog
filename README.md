The Agile Methodology was used to plan this project. This was implemented through GitHub and the Project Board, it can be found here: [Hiking Blog Project](https://github.com/users/emeliehansson/projects/4).

## User Stories

### Iteration 1
- As a Site Admin I can create, read, update and delete posts, so that I can manage my blog content.
- As a Site Admin, I can approve or disapprove comments, so that I can filter out objectionable comments.

### Iteration 2
- As a User, I can find a collection of hiking trails and hidden gems in my area, so that I can discover new favourite places.
- As a user, I can click into the hiking path I find interesting, so that I can view the whole post on one page.
- As a user, I can save hiking trails, so that I can easily access the ones of interest to me.
- As a User, I can clearly understand the purpose of the website, so that I can see if the site is relevant for me.

### Iteration 3
- As a User, I can click to enter a blog post, so that I can view all the information on one page.
- As a User, I want to be able to read other users comments, so that I can take part of the conversation.
- As a User, I can register for an account, so that I can add my own blog posts with hiking trails in my area.
- As a User, I can create, update and delete my post, so that I can amend errors or add more information.
- As a User, I can find contact information on a separate page, so that I can contact the person responsible for the blog.
- As a User, I also want to know the difficulty level of the trail, so that I can adapt according to my abilities.

Through the use of the Kanban board in the projects view in Github, the project was divided into a few different sections:

- Todo
- In Progress
- Done
- Backlog (future additions)
