# The Hiking Trail Blog - Project Portfolio 4

## **Agile Methodology**

## User Stories

### Iteration 1
- As a Site Admin I can create, read, update and delete posts, so that I can manage my blog content.
- As a Site Admin, I can approve or disapprove comments, so that I can filter out objectionable comments.


### Iteration 2
- As a User, I can find a collection of hiking trails and hidden gems in my area, so that I can discover new favourite places.
- As a user, I can click into the hiking path I find interesting, so that I can view the whole post on one page.
- As a user, I can save hiking trails, so that I can easily access the ones of interest to me.

### Iteration 3
- As a User, I can clearly understand the purpose of the website, so that I can see if the site is relevant for me.
